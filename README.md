# Cost efficient way of product wastage collection from customers of e-commerce.

In this technological era due to increase in the use of mobile phones and internet, e-commerce had a huge boom. So along with this increase in e-commerce, the wastage produce along with it is also increasing in the form of plastic wrappings, bubble wraps etc. These types of wastes are called e-commerce wastage. This e-commerce wastage can be decreased if a company can make a way to reuse the product wrappings in a cost-efficient way.

So, we are proposing an algorithm that can provide a cost-efficient way to collect the product packagingâ€™s back from the customer. This algorithm collects the location of the customer when the customer taps his mobile on the NFC enabled packaging. Then we process the locations of the all the customers who used this feature. Then we monitor the density of people who are willing to return the packaging back at different locations.

We group these locations based on pin-codes which act as a natural way to group locations. Such that if the density of orders at a certain pin-code reaches the threshold. A product recovery agent is sent to the location. He follows the path generated by our algorithm which is obtained by careful calculation of cost, distance, duration of all the path combinations. Such that making the collection of product packaging an efficient one.
